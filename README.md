# ⚽ Basic Image Manipulation & Annotation with OpenCV

This project demonstrates basic computer vision operations using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It involves working with sports imagery — like this football near the goal — to apply:

- ✅ Image loading and visualization with `matplotlib`
- 🧠 Basic drawing (lines, rectangles, circles, text)
- 🔍 Pixel-level manipulations
- 🗂️ Notebook-based, interactive analysis

## 🖼️ Sample Use Case

> Annotating important elements in sports photography (e.g., ball position near goal line) for training machine learning models or broadcast analytics.

## 🧪 Technologies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / IPython
